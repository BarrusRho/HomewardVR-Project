# HomewardVR-Project
Repository for the game "Homeward".

Homeward is a seated virtual reality (VR) experience game that I created as part of my thesis during the final year of my Game Design university degree.

Homeward was implemented in conjunction with the Virtual Reality Sickness Reduction tool (VRSRT) - a game design tool I researched, designed and built - which aims to provide developers of VR games numerous ways in which to reduce the impact of VR sickness on players.  Consequently, Homeward should be very comfortable to play and have low instances of VR sickness.

Developed for the Oculus Rift on PC and made in Unity.

Story:

Exploring the themes of heartbreak and loneliness, Homeward takes you on a journey from losing one home to finding another.

Features:

Experience a beautifully melancholic journey.

Seek a new home.

Homeward is presented in the Low-Poly art style.

My reflections on the project:

I learned a great deal from being the sole developer working on Homeward.  I was able to further develop skills in C#, greatly increase my knowledge and comfort with Unity, understand and implement Oculus integration within Unity, as well as utilise my skills in Game Design and Project Management. Moreover, I had an exceptionally challenging yet fun time creating the game which further cemented my desire to continue developing games and the necessity of constantly needed to learn and improve my skills.

This particular project demonstrates the highlight of my skillet in many ways. The code in itself is functional and I have learned much since the conclusion of the project so I realise much of the code can be improved upon.  However, the project as a whole highlights a lot more than my coding ability.  The project highlights my motivation, determination, the ability to identify and solve problems, work within strict deadlines, my creativity and my commitment to self improvement/learning. These are all attributes that I know are essential to be a great game developer.
