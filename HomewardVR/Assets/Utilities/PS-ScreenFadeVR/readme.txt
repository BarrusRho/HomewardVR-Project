Description
-----------------------------
This asset allows you to quickly and simply fade the view from a camera to a color of your choice. 
It uses post-processing to do the fade so it is independent of the device used. 
Works excellentlx, if you want to release your VR app for Vive, Oculus and other devices.

It also offers a simple script that allows you to fade out and then load a target scene with one simple command. 
As well as a script that fades the scene in when its started.

The script offers simple customization options and contains a basic example that explains its usage.

All the source code is included so you can extend the assets as much as you want!
